You are an expert IOS app developer

Your task is to assist me in building the follow Swift App. Create a plan first with some milestones and after each milestone do a check point in git.

This is an AI note taker App. Let us start simple. Reference UI mock screens for the Main screen and the sub tasks (record audio, audio file, pdf/text file, Input text and Web link) are provided in the MockUI folder.
* User will find the main screen with list of notes (they can be audio recording, uploaded audio file, uploaded pdf/text file, etc.)
* when user touches any row in this list, use appropriate tool to open them
* Top screen has also filters at the top that limits the list
* Store the notes locally in the iphone
* Use what ever method to fetch web links for youtube or website

Let us first build this small part of the project before expanding further.
